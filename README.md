## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Basic JavaScript

### What I learned

I have learned how to create slide toggle theme button with the background color change on click. It was a bit of a challenge but I totally enjoyed that whole process. 

I have also learned how to make RWD better! To do it I used grid and from now on I am sure that I will use it more often. Before it seemd like its more complex. But I also found some tools that were useful to me.

### Continued development

I am certain, that my next project is gonna be more complex than any of my previous one. I really enjoyed coding this one but I feel like I need something more challenging. Of course I have learned something, like I wrote before, but I still feel hunger. Rawr

For sure my next project is going to be based more on JavaScript. My next goal is to learn powerful React!
